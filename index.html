                <h2>Meramec Caverns</h2>
                <p>Enthusiastic tour guides make the Meramec Caverns a great visit. It’s a truly breathtaking system of caverns and one of the most interesting geological sites in the United States.

Meramec Caverns costs $19.00 for adults and $9.50 for children aged 5-11. Children under 4 are free. </p>

                <h2>The Sophia M. Sachs Butterfly House</h2>
                <p>The Butterfly House is a not-for-profit organization which was established in 1995 to increase awareness of the natural habitat in which butterflies thrive. The Butterfly House opened its doors to the public on September 18, 1998 and provides educational opportunities to a diverse visitorship. In 2000 the outdoor area known as the Butterfly Garden was dedicated. The Butterfly House offers education programs, special events, lectures and, of course, the chance to witness butterflies in two habitats, one native and one tropical. In July, 2001, the Butterfly House became a division of the Missouri Botanical Garden, a leader in horticultural displays, research and education. The following year, 2002, the second expansion of the facility opened and was designated the "Emerson Lakeside Terrace". This plaza area is the site for many special events, both public and private. The same year, the Butterfly House began participating with Butterfly Conservation Initiative, BFCI, of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the next year it was accredited by the AZA becoming the only dedicated insect facility in this organization. Because the Facility is located in the Botanical Gardens it is a great place to explore, learn, and really experience nature's beauty.</p>

                <p>Housed in the 600,000 square-foot former International Shoe Company, the museum is an eclectic mixture of children’s playground, funhouse, surrealistic pavilion, and architectural marvel made out of unique, found objects. The brainchild of internationally acclaimed artist Bob Cassilly, a classically trained sculptor and serial entrepreneur, the museum opened for visitors in 1997 to the riotous approval of young and old alike.</p>
